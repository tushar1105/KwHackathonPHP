KW-Hackathon Web appliaction using PHP and MYSQL

Key fetaures of the applicaiton:

1. A registration module with server side validations in PHP.

2. Admin Login process is managed using AJAX and server side validaitons.

3. All details enterd are stored in the database for persistence.

4. Session based access is provided to prevent unauthorised access to resources.

5. Code is structured with relevant comments wherever the need be.

NOTE:
I have used both normal form submission and submitting form using AJAX.
For the registration module, normal form submission is used and for the admin login process I have used AJAX.
